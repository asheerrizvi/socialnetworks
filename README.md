# Social Networks

A Java program which models the flow of information through social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. 

## Getting Started

You can setup a local instance for this application and run it for yourself:

### Prerequisites

The only pre-requisite for running this application is a Java IDE. I used [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) while developing this and therefore the screenshots attached here are from Eclipse. 

### Installation

Clone the repository on your local machine and import it into your preferred IDE. On Eclipse, you can do this via the following path:
```
File > Import > General > Existing Projects in Workspace
```

## Running Locally

Run the application by executing "EarthquakeCityMap.java", this file can be found under the following path:
```
SocialNetworks > src > application > CapGraph.java
```

This program simualtes how choices of their connected peers affect the chocie of an individual in a social network. The program makes a specific number of runs in which it determines whether a node (individual) will switch their choice after a particular number of generations, this switch is determined by the intrinsic reward for a choice and the number of users of the other choice in their connected network. For example: I have simulated whether an owner of a particular gaming console switch their console based on the playerbase in their social network.
